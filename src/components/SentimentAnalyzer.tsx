              <p>
                Our sentiment analysis model was built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand how users feel about products and services on Twitter.
                The model currently classifies tweets as <strong className="text-positive">Positive</strong> or <strong className="text-negative">Negative</strong>.
              </p>

              <p>
                We are continuously improving the model by collecting more data, refining preprocessing, and balancing the training examples.
                Future updates will use advanced AI techniques such as:

              <p className="pt-2">
                Our goal is to make the model more accurate, fair, and context-aware â€” ensuring that both positive and negative sentiments are understood equally well.
